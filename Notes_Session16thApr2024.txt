JSP is also one of the web technology to develop server side web applications. 
the main purpose of the jsp is to overcome the limitations of the servlets. 

A JSP page consists of HTML tags and JSP tags. 
The JSP pages are easier to maintain than Servlet because we can separate designing and development. It provides some additional features such as Expression Language, Custom Tags, etc.

Advantages of JSP over Servlet
There are many advantages of JSP over the Servlet. They are as follows:

1) Extension to Servlet
JSP technology is the extension to Servlet technology. We can use all the features of the Servlet in JSP. 
In addition to, we can use implicit objects, predefined tags, expression language and Custom tags in JSP, that makes JSP development easy.

2) Easy to maintain
JSP can be easily managed because we can easily separate our business logic with presentation logic. In Servlet technology, we mix our business logic with the presentation logic.

3) Fast Development: No need to recompile and redeploy
If JSP page is modified, we don't need to recompile and redeploy the project. The Servlet code needs to be updated and recompiled if we have to change the look and feel of the application.

4) Less code than Servlet
In JSP, we can use many tags such as action tags, JSTL, custom tags, etc. that reduces the code. Moreover, we can use EL, implicit objects, etc.

The Lifecycle of a JSP Page

The JSP pages follow these phases:

Translation of JSP Page
Compilation of JSP Page
Classloading (the classloader loads class file)
Instantiation (Object of the Generated Servlet is created).
Initialization ( the container invokes jspInit() method).
Request processing ( the container invokes _jspService() method).
Destroy ( the container invokes jspDestroy() method).
-------------------------------
Every jsp file is one of the servlet page. 
demo.jsp <==> demo.java

Scriptlet Tag :- this tag purpose is to write java code within it. 
<%
	java code
%>
--------------------------
Some Implicit Objects in JSP

Class 		Object
----------------------------------------
PrintWriter       		out
HttpServletRequest		resquest
HttpServletResponse		response
HttpSession			session
-----------------------------------------
How to import packages in jsp file

<%@ page import="package name" %>
<%@ page import="java.util.*" %>
------------------------------------------
Jsp allows to include one page content into another page. 
<jsp:include  page="pagename">
