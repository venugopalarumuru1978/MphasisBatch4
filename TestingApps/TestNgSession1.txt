What is an TestNG?
--------------
It is one of the testing framework for different types of testings for java applications.
1. UnitTesting
2. End-To-End Testing
3. Integration Testing
4. Smoke Testing
5. Functional Testing

When it is compare with Junit, Junit is only meant for Unit Testing
TestNG is developed by inspiring from Junit(Java) and NUnit(Dotnet) for different 
type of testings.

In TestNG = NG stands for Next Generation
 
Differences b/w Junit  and TestNG

1.  Annotations:-  Both Junit and TestNG are having annotations, In TestNG we got more no of 	annotations which are most use full when compare to JUNIT.
2.  Test Cases will be executed parellelly in TestNG whereas junit will not allow this.
3.  As per the TestNG, if required a test method can have parameters, where junit will not.
4.  Data Providers for TestNG:-  these are used to pass values to the test methods. 
		It can be done manually  or  with excel sheet. 
5.  TestNG allows to generate HTML based reports whereas Junit will not. 
6.  It also generates the Logs.

Software Requirements of the TestNG:-

1.  if the application is Maven, then add it's related "dependency". 
		or
    if the application is Normal Project, then add it's related jar files. 

		<dependency>
		    <groupId>org.testng</groupId>
		    <artifactId>testng</artifactId>
		    <version>7.10.2</version>
		    <scope>test</scope>
		</dependency>

2.  Once dependency / jar files are added to the application, we need configure TestNG tool for the 
	working editor(Eclipse/IntelliJ/)
	It has to be done as follows(Eclipse)
		Help Menu - Eclipse Market Place - Enter following text "TestNG for Eclipse" in search 			area - then Click Search Button
		It will show an Option "TestNG for Eclipse" - there we can find "Install" button
			click that button to install and finish the installation. 
-----------------------------------------------------------
Note :-  while executing testcases, TestNG follows asending order of the TestCase Method Names.
--------------------------------
Annotations in TestNG:- 

These all annotations works based on testng xml file sequence.

@BeforeTest	:-  Before Start the test tag
@AfterTest	:-  After Completion of the test tag
@BeforeMethod	:-  Before start the method tag
@AfterMethod    :-  After completion of the method tag
@BeforeSuite	:-  Before start the Suite tag
@AfterSuite	:-  After completion of the suite tag
@BeforeClass
@AfterClass 

Sequence of these Annotations

BeforeSuite -> BeforeTest -> BeforeClass -> BeforeMethod

----------------------------------------
Test Seniories :- This is the concept of executing group of test methods which located in same or different classes. 

Class - 1 :  A, B, C
Class - 2 :  D, E, F, G
Class - 3 :  H, I, J

Seniorio - 1 :- wants to execute some test cases
		A, E, G, I

Working With TestNG Xml File:-
1. What is Testng xml
	It is an xml file where it consist collection of testcase configurations.
2. What is the need of testng xml file.
	When test cases are distributed into multiple classes and from that only specific testcases 		need to execute, in that case this xml file is needed. 
3. How to create a testng xml file
		Right Click on Application - New - TestNG - Convert to TestNG - follow the remaining 		process.
4. How to add the test cases to the xml file
<suite name="name of suite">
	// collection of test cases is called suite
	<test  name="name of the test"  enabled="true/false">
		<classes>
			<class name="name of the class">
				<methods>
					<include name="testmethodname" />
					.......
				</methods>
			</class>
			
			....
		</classes>
	</test>
	.......
</suite>
5. How to execute the tests using xml file
	Right Click on Xml File - Run As - TestNG Suite
----------------------
<suite name="Suite">
  <test name="SampleTest">
    <classes>
      <class name="com.testngapps.DemoTest">
      		<methods>
      			<include name="TestXyz"/>
      			<include name="TestAbc"/>
      		</methods>
      </class>
      <class name="com.testngapps.TestWebMethods">
      		<methods>
      			<include name="FacebookTest"/>
      		</methods>
      </class>
    </classes>
  </test> <!-- Test -->
</suite> <!-- Suite -->
----------------------
Assertions :-

An assertion is a boolean expression at a specific point in a program which will be true unless there is a bug in the program. 
A test assertion is defined as an expression, which encapsulates some testable logic specified about a target under test.

As per the TestNG,  there are two types of Assertions

HardAssertions :-  These assertions are stop test case execution once Assertion is failed.
			To work with these assertions, "Assert" class is used.
 
SoftAssertions :-  These assertions will  not stop test case execution even once Assertion is failed.
			It will record all the assertions which failed and finally report will be
			provided. 

			To work with this, "SoftAssert" class is used. 
			
			Create an object for the "SoftAssert"  then use the methods. 
--------------------------------
Parameters in TestNG:-

Parameters are values which can be sent to the method at the time of calling. 
As per the TestNG, we can pass parameters to the Test Case methods also. 

To do this process:- 

Steps:- 
1.  Parameters are defined in testng xml file with specific values
	As per the testng  parameters are classified into two types
			1. Suite Level Parameters
				This type of parameters are defined in <Suite> tag and used in all the
				test cases.
			2. Test Level Parameters
				This type of parameters are defined in <Test> tag and used only for 
				that test case.

		To define paramters use following syntax
			<parameter  name="variablename"  value="value of the parameter" />
2.  Parameters are implemented for every test methods with following annotations
		@Parameters("variablename")
3.  here if parameters are using then that test method must have Arguments.
		public void methodname([arg])
		{
			......
		}
