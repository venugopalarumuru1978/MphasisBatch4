Today's Agenda
---------------
1. Stack
2. Queue
3. LinkedList
---------------
Stack :- It is one of the Linear DS to store colletion of objects/elements. 
	it follows a rule  called as "Last-In-First-Out".

Points to remembers:- 
	if stack is returning 
			-1  =it is empty
			0  = it has only one element
			n-1  =  it has full of values
			n = the stack is overflow.
As per java, stack will be discussed with Collections.

Stack is a predefined class and it has following methods. 

push() :-  to add an element to the stack
pop() :-  to remove an element from the stack
isEmpty() :- it is used check stack is empty or not
peek() :- which returns last element from the stack.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Queue :-  it is also one of the Linear DS to store collection of objects/elements. 
			it follows a rules called as "First-In-First-Out".
Operations :- 
Enqueue(add()) :-  to add elements to the queue
Dequeue(poll()) :-  to delete elements from the queue
isEmpty :- to check empty or not
isFull  :-  to check full or not
peek :-  it return a first value without removing value. 

As per the collection there is an interface "Queue", and it has set of implemented classes. 
-----------------
Linked List :-  It is also a linear type of data stucture, where it allows to store data in the form of nodes randomly. 

Linked List again classified into 3 types

Single Linked List
	In this process a there node which has data and address sections. 
		one node address will be stored into another node. so that final node having null address but data existed

Algorithm:-
1. Create a class with anyname

2. Create a inner class Node which has two attributes:  data and next is a pointer to the next node.
---------------
Double Linked List
----------------------------
Circular Linked List

It is a kind of linked list where head  node address will be stored in last node of the linked list.
----------------------------

What is a Node?

A node is a memory block which holds data and address of the another node. 
----------------------------------------------------
Sorting Techniques :- 

There are different sorting techniques to sort data either in asending or desending order. 

1.  Bubble Sorting
2.  Insertion
3.  Selection
4.  Merge
5.  Quick
6.  Counting 
7.  Radix 
8.  Bucket
9.  Shell
10. Heap
-----------------------
We are going to discuss 
1.  Bubble Sorting

Algorthim :- 
take 1st value, then campare with all other values weather those values bigger or not from 1st value, if bigger, then swap the value in their respective positions. 

This has to repeat until  all values gets sorted order. 
2.  Insertion
3.  Selection
4.  Counting 
5.  Radix

Searching Methods

1.  Unary Search
2.  Binary Search
