Today's Agenda:-
-----------------
JSON Server
HttpClient
RxJs(Observables)
-----------------
JSON Server :-  
JavaScript Object Notation

JSON formatted Data:- 

Employee :-

EmpID   EmpName    Job       Salary
--------------------------------
1001    Rakesh     Manager   10000
-------------------------------

{
"key": value,
"key": value,
.......
}

"employee":[ 
{
"empid":1001,
"empname" :"venugopal",
"job" :  "Manager", 
"salary":12000
},
{
"empid":1002,
"empname" :"Pavan",
"job" :  "developer", 
"salary":10000
}
]

this formated data will be placed in an file having an extension "json".
	employee.json


Steps to install json server

1. use following command to install at command prompt
		npm install -g json-server
2.  create db.json file to store data in json format
{
"employee":[ 
{
"empid":1001,
"empname" :"venugopal",
"job" :  "Manager", 
"salary":12000
},
{
"empid":1002,
"empname" :"Pavan",
"job" :  "developer", 
"salary":10000
}], 
"Student":[
{
	"rollno":101,
	"sname":"murali"
},
{
	"rollno":102,
	"sname":"kamal"
}]

}
3. to access data from db.json file, we have to start server by using following command
	json-server db.json

4.  Once server is started, that can be accessed with following url on browser
		http://localhost:3000/


To test any server operations like Add/View/Modify/Delete, we have to use a tool called as POSTMAN
It can be used for testing any kind of Services, like JSON/RESTAPI/Microservices/Web Services...

There are 4 types of requests 

1.  GET  :-  to view all the data
2.  GET/id :- to videw particular peace of info
3.  POST :-  to add data
4.  PUT :-  to modify data
5.  DELETE :-  to delete data
--------------------------------------------------
RxJS stands for *R*eactive E*x*tensions for *J*ava*S*cript, 

itâ€™s a library that gives us an implementation of Observables for JavaScript.
RxJS, is a reactive library used to implement reactive programming to deal with async implementation, callbacks, and event-based programs.

Observable :- It is a data source(events, http request, custom data source..) which sends data in the form of data packets to the observer.

Observer :-  It is an object that subscribes to the observable and listens to the data packets that sends by observable.

these two classes comes under RxJS Module.
--------------------
What is a Subscription?  
Normally Subscription means an arrangement to receive something.   

Similarly, in Angular applications Observables will be connected to observers and whenever they observe a new value or change in data, they will execute code with the help of Subscription and all the subscribed components will receive the updated outcome. 

There is a method to this action "subscribe()".
--------------------------------------------------
HttpClient :-  This class is used to send request and get responses with the help of any API's.

getmapping  = get()
postmapping = post()
putmapping = put()
deletemapping = delete()
-------------
Steps 

1. Create an app
2. Create components for the pages
3. Create service and then define methods to commnuniate with json-server for all http request.
4. Now using service methods, apply function in every component as per the requirement.
