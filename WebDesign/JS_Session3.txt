Today's agenda
---------------
JavaScript 
      Arrays
      JSON
TypeScript
---------------
Array :-  It is one of the data type where it allows to store multiple values. 
		var <variable_name> = [val1, val2, val3, ....]
			or
		var  <variable> = new Array(val1, val2, val3, ...)

arrays provides following two functions

push() :- adding value to the array at the ending position.
pop() :-  removing value from an array from ending position.

splice(index, no of values) :-  it allows to remove set of value(s) from specific index position.
----------------------------
JSON :-  JavaScript Object Notation

It is meant for tranmitting data b/w applications. whenever data is in json format, that can be used in any prog lang. 

var Object = {key:value, key:val, ......}
-----------------
TypeScript:- 
-----------------
It is a programming language which is developed by using JavaScript. 
It is a superset of JavaScript and it also consider as Extension to JavaScript. 

On the top of JavaScript,  We have couple of Other Script Languages
	1. jQuery
	2. ES6 - ECMA Script
	3. TypeScript

TypeScript consist of following concepts:- 
	1. JavaScript
	2. Data Types
	3. OOPS Concepts
	4. Misc Concepts
		Arrow Functions
		Multiline Strings
		String Interpolation
		Modules
		Enums
Advantages:- 
	1. It will support both script based data type like "var" and typescript based data types. 
		i.e. we can declare variables with "var/let" keyword
			or
		TypeScript provides following data types
			number 	:-  it is meant for both integer and decimal values
			string 	:-  It is meant for only strings
			boolean	:-  It is meant for only two valus like "true/false"
			any	:-  It is meant for storing any data type value. 
		with the help of above data types, the variable can be declared as follows
			var <variable name> :  <data type> = <value>;
	2. It allows to identify errors. 
	3. Intellisence	
------------------------------------
How to install software :-
	1.  Download and install Node JS.
	2.  Install TypeScript with following command from command prompt. 
		npm install typescript -g
---------------
	Node JS :-  It is a software a tool called as NPM(Node Package Manager).
	NPM :-  It is a library which is having nearly 8lakhs of library files which support for
		multiple languages like TypeScript, Angular, React JS, ....
		NPM Provides CLI - Command Line Enviornment - it will provide set of commands. 
---------------
Web Based Programming Languages
	1. Angular(TypeScript)
	2. React JS
	3. Node JS
	4. Express JS
	5. Vue JS

for these language, base script is "JavaScript".
-------------------
What is an NPM?
	Node Package Manager, It is the world's largest software library used for different web 			programming languages. 
	
	It is integrated with Node JS.

	Once we install Node JS, automatically "NPM" will be installed. 

	NPM is a freeware, it consist over 8Lakhs library files. 

	Once npm  is installed, it will provide a command prompt called as "CLI-Command Line Client".
	By using CLI, we can install software is required with commands. 

	To install Node JS, goto http://nodejs.org
------------------------
Steps to write TypeScript?
	1.  Open any editor(VSCode)
	2.  Code the program as per the requirement
	3.  Save the program with .ts extension
	4.  Compile the program with following command
		C:\>tsc  "filename.ts"
		Note :- Once it is compiled successfully, it will generate .js file for an execution.
	5.  Run the program with following command
		C:\>node  "filename.js"
-------------------------
Object Oriented Programming Structure(OOPS):-

It is a one type of programming methodology where it provides different concepts as follows
1. Object
2. Class
3. Encapsulation
4. Abstraction
5. Polymarphisum
6. Inheritance

the purpose of the OOPS is to provide "Data Security". 

What is an Object?
It is a thing in the real world which has set of attributes and functionality. 

Ex:- Car is an OBject
	- Attributes
		- Model
		- Color
		- Number
		- Seating Capacity
	- Functionality
		- Transportation of people
		- Changing of Gear
		- Breaks to Stop

What is a Class?
	It is a blueprint of the object (or)
	It is an encapsulated cell where it allows to define attributes and functionalities of an 		object.
		
	class <classname>
	{
		propertyname:datatype=<value>;
		......
		......
	
		method_name([arguments]):[return type]
		{
			body of the method
		}
	} 

	Once class is defined, we can create any number of the objects.
		var objectname = new ClassName([parameters]);
	
	we can access class members(variables/methods) with the help of object as follows
		objectname.variable/method


Access Specifiers :-  
These are the keywords which tells how to access class members inside and outside of the class.	

private :-  it allows to use class members only inside the class. 
public :-  it allows to use class members inside and outside of the class. 
protected :-  it allows to use one class members into another specific class. 
------------------------------
constructor :- 
It is a special method of the class which menat for specifing initial action for an object.
i.e. to initialize  class properties at the time of object creation. 

constructor([parameters])
{
	body of the constructor
}

a. it will execute automatically whenever object is created. 
b. It can take parameters but it won't return value. 
-----------------------------------
Inheritance:- It is the process of getting the features from parent class to child class. 

purpose of this concept is, resuability of the classes. 

Imp Points 
1.  Here parent item/class is called as Base Class  and Child item/class is called as Derived Class. 
2.  Inheritnce will be done from parent to child class only. 
3.  To inherit a class use following syntax
		class <child class name>  extends <parent class name>
		{
			body of the class
		}
4.   No need to create an object for parent classes, just create an object for child class then call 	the methods from parent and child classes.

Types of Inheritances :-  

1. Single Inheritance
2. Multi Level Inheritance
3. Multiple Inheritance
4. Hirarchical Inheritance
5. Hybrid Inheritance

Note :-  As per the Inheritance, a child class can inherit only one parent class. 
--------------------------
Interface :-
It is one type of class where it allows only declaration of the variables and methods. 

Purpose of the interface is to achieve multiple inheritance. So that every interface works like as Parent Class. 

interface <interface name>
{
	method declarations
}

once interface is created, that has to inherit to the class with the help of "implements" keyword. 
multiple interface can be inherited to the class. 

class <classname> implements <interface name1, name2, ...>
{
	....
}

within that class, the interface methods will be defined.
---------------------------------------
As per TypeScript, following OOPS Concept cannot be used

1. Constructor Overloading
2. Abstract classes and Abstract method
3. Polymarphisum
	Method Overload and Method Override
---------------------------------------
Modules:-

A module is an typescript class file(s) where it allows to export from one program to another program.

purpose:- to export one class into another class to use within the application. 

to create a class to export, use "export" keyword at the time of class definition. 

export class <class name>
{
	body of the class
}

the classes which is defined to export, that can be imported in some other class as follows

import  {export classname}  from "./export class filename";

class <classname>
{
....
}
-----
Enumerations :-

It is a collection of constants grouping under one unit. 
It acts as a user defined data type.

enum  <name>
{
	const-1, const-2, ....
}

once it is created, it can be assigned into a variable of the class. 

class <classname>
{
	variable:enum_name;
}
