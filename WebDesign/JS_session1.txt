Today's Agenda
---------------
1. BootStrap Continution
2. JavaScript
---------------
JavaScript :- 

What is a Script?
	programming with web page is called as Script. 

	As per web, scripting is meant for adding functionality for the web pages. 

There are couple of script languages, 

VBScript(Outdated)  -  it works only in IE Browser. Now No IE Browser. 
JavaScript
jQuery		    -  Modified version of JavaScript
TypeScript	    -  It one more type of Script, developed on the top of JS.
ECMA Script(ES5/ES6) -  Advanced Features of the JS.

from these script languages, JavaScript is a Browser Independent Script Language. 
On the top of JS, we got web based front end programming languages. 
	Angular
	React JS
	Node JS
	Express JS
	Vue JS
------------------------------
What is a JavaScript?
	it is a loosely typed script language which meant for adding features to the webpages
			1.  Dynamic Pages
			2.  Validating Inputs of the web page.

important points
--------
1.  It is a loosely typed script language, so that it is not having any type of data types for variable creations explicitly.  Based on value assigned, the type will be decided. 
	
JS will have implicit data types
	number
	string
	boolean
	any
variable will be declared as follows
	var / let  <variable name> = <value>;
	
	var x = 100;
	var y = 12.34;
	var str = "SimpliLearn"
	var ch = true

2.  Any script code has to be integrated with html web page, so javascript also same.
	to write js program in html page, we have to use following tag which has to be present
	either in <head>/<body> tag. 

	<script type="text/javascript">
		js code
	</script>
			or
	Separate .js files will be created, where we can code it and those files can import into 
	html pages with following tag. 

	<script  src="script filename" />

3.  JS is a Object based script language, so that it provides pre-defined objects to perform different 	actions.
	some of the objects
			document -  it is one of the object which represents currently working 
					web page. 
			console  -  it is also one of the object, which represents browser 
					command prompt. 

	to print something on the browser
		document.writeln("text"/variable)
	to print something on the browser console
		console.log("text"/variable)


4.  Every script language is a function based language, so that for every task we have to create a 	user defined function and that can be called whenever it is required. 

	function <fun_name>([arg])
	{
		action
	}

	here we can also impliment local and global variables. 

	
	
5.  Event Driven Programming:- 
	Every GUI based lang provides set of tools to give inputs, to perform other actions also. 
	As per gui based lang,  every action should call it as an Event. 

	What is a Event? 
		Action(Event Props) + Task(Method)  
		An action oriented method which will be executed based on situation. 

		Event 		Props
		------------------------
		click		onclick(it will execute whenever button clicked)
		change 		onchange
		mousemove	onmousemove
		doubleclick	ondblclick
		keypress	onkeypress

	these all event occurs for every tool what we are using in web page(buttons, textboxes, ....)

6. Once we create any tool with "name" prop, we can get/set values from those tool as follows
		to get value :  formname.toolname.value
		to set value :  formname.toolname.value = <val>
--------------------
OOPS - Object Oriented Programming Structure (object, class, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymarphisum)

Object oriented prog lang
	java, C++, 
Object based prog lang
	all script lang's(javascript, python)
